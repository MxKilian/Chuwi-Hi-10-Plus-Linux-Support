# Chuwi-Hi-10-Plus-Linux-Support
*Support for running Linux on Chuwi Hi 10 Plus*

First of all I want to link this awesome guide I originally followed to get Linux working on my Chuwi Hi 10 Plus - [Linux On Hi10](https://github.com/danielotero/linux-on-hi10).
By now, new kernel versions were released and the out of box support is pretty decent.
